Hi Tom.
Peter, the new intern that join us the past week have been completed the training stage succesfully.
His performance for completing his duties was appropiately, but I receive some comments about his behavior with the team.
I think that we bring him some suggestions for improve his team's interaction maybe with some tips about team mentoring and topics related about that.
Let me know about your opinion.
Best regards!
